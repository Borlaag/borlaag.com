The mandatory first post in which I introduce this new blog along with some details on what
tools and other resources are used to make it. Also included are details about relevant content
and code licenses.

<!-- more -->

My goals with this blog are fairly unstructured, but mostly I want a place to put my thoughts
and designs on primarily software related stuff.

## Stuff Used

This blog is a static site generated using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static website
generator written in Rust. I'm using a modified version of the [zola-paper](https://github.com/schoenenberg/zola-paper) theme.

Some of the modifications include color customizations and font changes. I'm using the [GitHub Mona & Hubot Sans](https://github.com/mona-sans) 
fonts for text and [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font for code.

The website is currently deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), though I plan to self-host
once I get my server up and running. I'll likely write a separate post about that in the near future.
