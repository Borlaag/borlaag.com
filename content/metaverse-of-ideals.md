This post explores the optimistic vision for the metaverse, and of virtual/augmented reality
becoming the interface for general computing in the future. The counter-view will be
discussed in a [follow-up post](/metaverse-of-despair).

**Disclaimer:** I am using images from [Meta](https://meta.com) but have no affiliation with them or any
corporation working on this stuff at the time of writing, nor any other vested interests beyond a personal interest in the technology.

## Background

The idea itself isn't new. Philosophers have discussed [Simulated Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality)
for centuries and virtual reality is just the technical implementation detail making their thought-experiments
a bit more real. Science fiction authors have explored virtual reality ([Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One)
and [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) being classic examples) in different forms.

I'll generally define the "metaverse" the way I think _most_ people view it.

> _The metaverse is a universally connected virtual reality world in which humans exist and interact with each other._

The main reactions this gets is usually about why anyone would want to spend their time in a virtual
world, or whether it's a good thing for society to become more glued to screens and impersonal social environments.
I whole-heartedly agree. I **don't** want to live in that world, either.

I would define my view of the "metaverse" more broadly.

> _The metaverse is an extension of our physical world._

## Social Connection

Lets set the stage for a utopian use-case of social networks and how it compares to social media as it exists today.
Social media often brings out the worst in people and not to over-simplify but part of this, I think, is the lack
of physical human connection and the inability to perceive the way we are hard-wired . It's easier to be abbrasive
when the person on the other end of the keyboard is de-humanized. People are generally friendlier face-to-face.

Now, as cringe-worthy as the current tech may seem, imagine being able to feel eye-contact the way we do in real life.
See and interpret gestures and body language. Hear the unique patterns of their voice. Imagine this being
"as good as" real life at least in our perception of the experience.

Do you think this might actually enhance the depth of human connection over a virtual network? I want to believe it would.

> _But... Real life exists_

Yes, but in addition to real life connections I have grown from connections I've made in chat rooms, online forums,
and multiplayer games. These connections are not mutually exclusive from real life relationships. They formed me
to be more open-minded and loving of others. They also gave me an escape from my world when it was toxic.

I imagine social connection in the most idealistic vision of the metaverse leading to more open-minded and representive world-views
in people across the world who otherwise might not connect on a fundamentally human level.

## Physical Constraints

Moving away from the inter-personal relationships between people, I also envision the metaverse extending our spaces
in useful and productive ways. The best example of this is what Meta introduced with [Horizon Workrooms](https://www.meta.com/work/workrooms/).
Go ahead and get that multi-monitor setup with an unnecessary amount of screens you always dreamed of ;-)

This is something that exists today and I'm eager to try it. My best guess is it's a subpar experience compared to having
three real 4K HDR 120hz monitors, but the proof-of-concept is there and with iterative research and development this
could become a pretty incredible upgrade to our computing environments. Three-dimensional environments also seem more
natural when your interface (_you_) can move in three dimensions.

My point isn't that everyone needs information dense screens beamed directly to their retinas, but rather that virtual
spaces can be an effective extension of our physical environments without the similar constraints. I already spend hours every day
working at my computer and have an entire room with physical equipment dedicated to this. Virtual whiteboards, screens, notepads, etc. 
seem like good upgrades.

## Human-Computer Interfaces Evolved

Computers continue to improve but our interfaces to use them have not changed much in decades. I have
nothing against mice, trackpads, or keyboards, but we shouldn't just stop there... right? I remember hacking on the
[Xbox Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) and thinking [Magic Leap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Leap) was,
well, magic! Engineers and researchers have continued to fine-tune these interfaces and I think we're starting to see the fruits
of their labor.

Iterative improvements feel slow but after seeing some of the research being applied into a consumer-facing product 
like the [Meta Quest Pro](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-pro/), I can't help but be excited for what these devices 
will be capable of in 5, 10, or 20 years from now.

In fact, we don't even have to imagine that hard. During some press events Meta showcased what they called their
"North Star" prototype form-factor.

With that form-factor in mind, and extrapolating what advances in things like hand and face tracking might give us
in the future, we can imagine a device that you can carry with you (like a phone) that is capable of dropping you into
an immersive (or augmented) computing environment that is as capable (or more) as a desktop computer. That would be a massive
paradigm shift in our relationship with computers and what they can do for us.

[Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) along with our bodies
could control powerful computing environments effortlessly. We could be walking in the park and decide to drop
into a quick working session to write some code on a bench, with the park as our peripheral environment and a
screen projected into our field of vision. What's interesting to me is the idea that experiencing the world
wouldn't be at odds with the virtual world. I could be in both. I could even go for a walk _with_ someone who
wasn't physically able to be there with me, but we would both be able to _see_ each other and connect on a
deeply personal and human level.

I don't want to be behind a computer. I want my computer to be with me. Accessible, efficient, and uncompromising.
