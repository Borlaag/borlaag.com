  <div class="post-content"><p>The mandatory first post in which I introduce this new blog along with some details on what
tools and other resources are used to make it. Also included are details about relevant content
and code licenses.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>My goals with this blog are fairly unstructured, but mostly I want a place to put my thoughts
and designs on primarily software related stuff.</p>
<h2 id="stack">Stack</h2>
<p>This blog is a static site generated using <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, a static website
generator written in Rust. I'm using a slightly modified version of the
<a href="https://github.com/schoenenberg/zola-paper">zola-paper</a> theme.</p>
<p>Some of the modifications include subtle colors customizations the use of the
<a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> font for textand <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> for code.</p>
<p>The website is currently deployed to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, though I plan to self-host
once I get my server up and running. I'll likely write a separate post about that in the near future.</p>
